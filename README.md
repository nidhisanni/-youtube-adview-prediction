# YouTube Adview Prediction

This is a machine learning project where I tried to predict the number of ad views on YouTube videos using features like views, likes, shares, comments, etc.

It's one of my earlier projects while learning ML, and it helped me understand the end-to-end workflow — from data cleaning to model evaluation. I applied multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, and also built a basic neural network using Keras.

The dataset was provided as a part of a practice task (originally from Kaggle). I cleaned it, explored it through visualizations, and tried to improve performance with feature scaling and tuning.

This was more of a learning project, so it’s not perfect — but I learned a lot doing it.
